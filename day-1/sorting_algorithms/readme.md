# Sorting Algorithms

# Bubble sort 

  time complexity O(n^2) quadratic

  In Bubble sort after every iteration on element from array gets correct position.<br/>
  
  And in every iteration n comparisions are done to decide correct position of element.

# stable and unstable sort

  This comes in picture when we have duplicate values in array.

  If array is having duplicate values and at the time of sorting relative order of duplicate values is changed then it is known as **unstable sort**. 

  It doesn't matter when we are sorting primitives.

  Bubble sort is stable sort.
